"Me" in this document usually refers to David Walter Seikel, the main author.

Unless otherwise stated, all of this is covered by the following BSD
style license.  Most of the rest is either BSD, MIT, or public domain. 
To avoid viral contamination, only LGPL varieties of GPL code will be
linked.  See below for details.

The Enlightenment Foundation Libraries are mostly BSD, and copyright by
the various people mentioned in their respective AUTHORS files, except -

Edje's epp - GPL 2.
Eina - LGPL 2.1.
Embryo - partly BSD, partly something similar to BSD.

See the various COPYING and AUTHORS files for details.

Epp is a separate tool used to process .edc source files, but otherwise
not a part of the SledjHamr system.  The only .edc file is the LuaSL
test harness.  So the viral nature of GPL does not apply.

Note that eina is the only GPL thing that is linked, and it's LGPL, so
linking to non GPL stuff is fine.

Note that luaproc has been extensively rewritten by me, but large parts
of it still exist in the original form, and the rewritten bits tended to
stick with the original design.

All things below this line are temporary things, some of them already
removed.  They are listed coz they are still in the source repo, even
though not in the current latest version.  Thus they are being
distributed, even if not by default.  None of them are counted as
"linked" for licensing purposes, as they are no longer used.  Those
things that actually care about linking in their licenses where never
linked, merely used as examples for research.

The flex and btyacc source files, plus the C source files that wrap them
in LuaSL, where originally based on flex and bison examples provided on
the Wikipedia page -

There is no longer any parts of that code left I think.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

There used to be flex and bison source files for a LSL parser, taken
from from the SL viewer under GPL 2 and copyright at some unknown date
(due to missing copyright notice in those specific files) by Linden
Research, Inc.  Those files have gone away, as I wrote my own, and most
of it was useless to me anyway.  Never actually used them, so GPL terms
do not apply.  The flex source file actually used is written by me,
bison is not used at all.
