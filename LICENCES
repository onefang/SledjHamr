"Me" in this document usually refers to David Walter Seikel, the main author.

Unless otherwise stated, all of this is covered by the following BSD

To avoid viral contamination, only LGPL varieties of GPL code will be

The Enlightenment Foundation Libraries are mostly BSD, and copyright by
the various people mentioned in their respective AUTHORS files, except -

Edje's epp - GPL 2.
Eina - LGPL 2.1.
Embryo - partly BSD, partly something similar to BSD.

See the various COPYING and AUTHORS files for details.

Epp is a separate tool used to process .edc source files, but otherwise
not a part of the SledjHamr system.  The only .edc file is the LuaSL
test harness.  So the viral nature of GPL does not apply.

Note that eina is the only GPL thing that is linked, and it's LGPL, so
linking to non GPL stuff is fine.

[Note, EFL is no longer included, but it's source is still in the git history.]

Irrlicht includes this -

The license of the Irrlicht Engine is based on the zlib/libpng license.
Even though this license does not require you to mention that you are
using the Irrlicht Engine in your product, an acknowledgement
would be highly appreciated.

Please note that the Irrlicht Engine is based in part on the work of
the Independent JPEG Group, the zlib, and libpng. This means that if you use
the Irrlicht Engine in your product, you must acknowledge somewhere
in your documentation that you've used the IJG code and libpng. It would
also be nice to mention that you use the Irrlicht Engine and the zlib.
See the README files in the jpeglib and the zlib for
further informations.

LEGAL ISSUES
============

In plain English:

1. We don't promise that this software works.  (But if you find any bugs,
   please let us know!)
2. You can use this software for whatever you want.  You don't have to pay us.
3. You may not pretend that you wrote this software.  If you use it in a
   program, you must acknowledge somewhere in your documentation that
   you've used the IJG code.

In legalese:

The authors make NO WARRANTY or representation, either express or implied,
with respect to this software, its quality, accuracy, merchantability, or
fitness for a particular purpose.  This software is provided "AS IS", and you,
its user, assume the entire risk as to its quality and accuracy.

This software is copyright (C) 1991-2012, Thomas G. Lane, Guido Vollbeding.
All Rights Reserved except as specified below.

Permission is hereby granted to use, copy, modify, and distribute this
software (or portions thereof) for any purpose, without fee, subject to these
conditions:
(1) If any part of the source code for this software is distributed, then this
README file must be included, with this copyright and no-warranty notice
unaltered; and any additions, deletions, or changes to the original files
must be clearly indicated in accompanying documentation.
(2) If only executable code is distributed, then the accompanying
documentation must state that "this software is based in part on the work of
the Independent JPEG Group".
(3) Permission for use of this software is granted only if the user accepts
full responsibility for any undesirable consequences; the authors accept
NO LIABILITY for damages of any kind.

These conditions apply to any software derived from or based on the IJG code,
not just to the unmodified library.  If you use our work, you ought to
acknowledge us.

Permission is NOT granted for the use of any IJG author's name or company name
in advertising or publicity relating to this software or products derived from
it.  This software may be referred to only as "the Independent JPEG Group's
software".

We specifically permit and encourage the use of this software as the basis of
commercial products, provided that all warranty or liability claims are
assumed by the product vendor.


ansi2knr.c is included in this distribution by permission of L. Peter Deutsch,
sole proprietor of its copyright holder, Aladdin Enterprises of Menlo Park, CA.
ansi2knr.c is NOT covered by the above copyright and conditions, but instead
by the usual distribution terms of the Free Software Foundation; principally,
that you must include source code if you redistribute it.  (See the file
ansi2knr.c for full details.)  However, since ansi2knr.c is not needed as part
of any program generated from the IJG code, this does not limit you more than
the foregoing paragraphs do.

The Unix configuration script "configure" was produced with GNU Autoconf.
It is copyright by the Free Software Foundation but is freely distributable.
The same holds for its supporting scripts (config.guess, config.sub,
ltmain.sh).  Another support script, install-sh, is copyright by X Consortium
but is also freely distributable.

The IJG distribution formerly included code to read and write GIF files.
To avoid entanglement with the Unisys LZW patent, GIF reading support has
been removed altogether, and the GIF writer has been simplified to produce
"uncompressed GIFs".  This technique does not use the LZW algorithm; the
resulting GIF files are larger than usual, but are readable by all standard
GIF decoders.

We are required to state that
    "The Graphics Interchange Format(c) is the Copyright property of
    CompuServe Incorporated.  GIF(sm) is a Service Mark property of
    CompuServe Incorporated."

All things below this line are temporary things, some of them already
removed.  They are listed coz they are still in the source repo, even
though not in the current latest version.  Thus they are being
distributed, even if not by default.  None of them are counted as
"linked" for licensing purposes, as they are no longer used.  Those
things that actually care about linking in their licenses where never
linked, merely used as examples for research.

The flex and btyacc source files, plus the C source files that wrap them

There is no longer any parts of that code left I think.

There used to be flex and bison source files for a LSL parser, taken
from from the SL viewer under GPL 2 and copyright at some unknown date
(due to missing copyright notice in those specific files) by Linden
Research, Inc.  Those files have gone away, as I wrote my own, and most
of it was useless to me anyway.  Never actually used them, so GPL terms
do not apply.  The flex source file actually used is written by me,
bison is not used at all.
