We don need no stinkin' accounts.

We don't really need accounts, so we can do away with them.  Though
obviously since SledjHamr is designed to be a flexible set of tools
rather than one big take it or leave it system, people can use what ever
accounts system they need for their purposes.  SledjHamr not only doesn't
impose an accounts system, we eliminate the need for one in the general
case.  So we don't have to write one.  B-)

When a user fires up the extantz client for the first time, it can use
their local computer account name as the users name (I think most
operating systems make you create one when you install them).  Extantz
could also do a reverse DNS lookup on the computers IP, and likely end
up with an ISPs dynamic IP reverse mapping, or maybe a real domain name.

Extantz then tries to connect to a love server running on the same
computer, or starts one if it can't find one.  This local love server by
default runs a small grid, with maybe a nice little cottage, and a star
gate.  This is the users home, they can do what ever they like with it.

The star gate works similar to current OpenSim hypergates, linking to
external grids and allowing HyperGrid access to them.  Since the user
already has a local name and domain name, with the local love server
acting as the users home HyperGrid server, they are good to go visit
other grids.  No real in world account need ever be created.

The drawback is that the virtual worlds will be filled with lots of
root@123_231.bigisp-dyn.com users.  Naturally it should be simple for
users to change the default name to anything they want.
