The Naminator eliminates human readable names, to make way for computer
names for SkyNet.  Or something.

In world names can be anything, but they map more or less to file names
and URLs, so the names have to be munged accordingly.  A further issue
is that different in world objects can have the same name.  Lots of
copies of the same thing, or two different things that happen to be
called the same thing.  No one is gonna individually name each tree in a
forest, or every lamppost in the city.  File names and URLs have to be
unique.  The Naminator deals with munging names to deal with these
issues.  It should generate names that are compatible with a variety of
operating and file systems, as well as being URL compatible.  This is
such a useful thing to do that it should be a shared library, even if it
will be tiny.
