<h2>Late night realization about multiple asset servers and Censorship and such.</h2>
<p>(04:33:43 AM) alice_crush: Oh!</p>
<p>(04:36:29 AM) alice_crush: What if we let folks run more than one inventory asset server, and make some asset servers private/subscription. Which just means if a person takes no action they'll never see an asset from a private server. *Then* say folks in Japan can have a sim full of nasty lolicon, and folks from countries that make it illegal to see such pictures won't ever be accidentally exposed. *And* the grid will stay 'pure' never serving "bad" images. "Hey idiot, if you choose to download illegal content, don't complain to us!"</p>
<p>(04:38:17 AM) alice_crush: so you could walk around in a t-shirt with a grossly illegal image on it, and unless someone is subscribed to the right asset server they just see gray.</p>
<p>(04:39:07 AM) alice_crush: have to get to like phase 2 or whatever, not the stop gap quick fix proxying feature</p>
<p>(04:40:26 AM) onefang: That goes to the whole "Hey it's just a web server, you can implement whatever access policy you want" thing.</p>
<p>(04:40:53 AM) onefang: "You are not authorized to see this t-shirt.".</p>
<p>(04:41:04 AM) alice_crush: though would need some special client side controls/subscriptions something like that.</p>
<p>(04:41:26 AM) onefang: "Knomes stole this skirt, quick get hippos."</p>
<p>(04:41:34 AM) alice_crush: "This texture above your security grade" lol</p>
<p>(04:43:07 AM) onefang: "These are not the clothes you are searching for."</p>
<p>(04:43:10 AM) alice_crush: minor issue of when uploading a texture specifying which asset server it goes to...</p>
<p>(04:44:03 AM) alice_crush: you could give me your illegal images (drawing of the profit, peace be on him) I could put them out in my sim, and never see the blasphemy myself</p>
<p>(04:44:33 AM) onefang: Well, no, that's the whole point of allowing multiple inventory stores. You get to manage them, decide what goes where. Sometimes using ordinary web CMS software, or a file browser for local ones..</p>
<p>(04:45:37 AM) alice_crush: Hmmm maybe folks could sell say a pg skin and a X version, and folks could choose to avoid the X asset servers... and not see grey people.</p>
<p>(04:46:20 AM) alice_crush: Lol, theres always a clever policy choice that makes the thought police un necessary.</p>
<p>(04:46:47 AM) alice_crush: LL will hate it (Breaks the shared experience rule)</p>
<p>(04:47:00 AM) alice_crush: OS will probably hate it too</p>
<p>(04:48:08 AM) onefang: I'm not particularly worried about pissing off those two groups.</p>
<p>(04:48:37 AM) alice_crush: I would rather make thought police optional, then market forces will eliminate them.</p>
<p>(04:48:02 AM) alice_crush: some day could have certificates for asset servers, collect them in classes "PG servers", "IP Clean servers" lol</p>

<h2>More linear description of above</h2>
<p>Imagine that texture assets can come from multiple sources. When a sim tells your client about a texture it only tells you an ID, your client has to find out which server has the resource for you.</p>
<p>Imagine your client has a list of servers to try, it can simply go through the list of servers stopping as soon as a server gives a response.</p>
<p>Imagine that some of the servers in the list come from standard places such as the sim. Imagine that other of the servers come from a manually selected list of private subscription servers.</p>
<p>Say I am in simulator 101, I get told about a resource named "409" from the simulator. I check all the asset servers I know. If I don't find it, I show a blank/gray texture.</p>
<p>You might be in the same simulator, and you get told about the same resource named "409" by the simulator. In addition to the simulator though, you have a private server you can check, and there you find resource "409" so you client can draw it for you.</p>
<p>In this way you and I looking at a third person might see something different. You see the third person wearing a shirt with the logo of a sports team. I see a very plain gray 'slider' shirt, not even with textures cuffs and hems.</p>
