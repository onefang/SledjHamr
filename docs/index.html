Welcome to the SledjHamr home!

<p>OMG might stand for Open Magic Garden, but we are open to other suggestions.</p>
<p>Open Management Group have a US registered trade mark of "OMG", and they deal with computer integration standards for "enterprise", in other words, big business, with deep pockets plus scary lawyers, and too close to what we are doing for us to get away with it for long. So, in the interests of having a name so I can just start coding dammit, I'm going with my original name of SledjHamr. It's not very marketing friendly, and even I have to stop and think exactly how it is spelled. lol</p>
<p>We don't have a great name for it, until recently I liked NGIW (Next Generation Immersive Web) best, but OMG has plenty of appeal. What it is, even if we don't have a clear name for it, is an improved version of OpenSimulator and Imprudence, a vision of better virtual worlds. We have a few pages talking about it. Check out:</p>

<p>We have a code repo on github now - <a href="https://github.com/onefang/SledjHamr">https://github.com/onefang/SledjHamr</a> with just a small README that points to this page. We can finally start writing code.</p>
