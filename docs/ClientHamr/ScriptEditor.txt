One idea I had, though this will only work if the stars align, is to use
my toybox editor to edit scripts.  This saves effort, and results in a
more user friendly editor, since people can pick their preferred editor
style.

The theory is that I'm writing a generic editor for toybox, and it needs
to A) emulate a few popular historic editors like vi, emacs, nano, and
mcedit.  B) gradually morph into a half decent source code editor. 
Since I basically would have to do B) for extantz anyway, might as well
just write it once and use it twice.

As a bonus you get a shell in world, with toybox commands, and could
also run a Lua interpreter in it.

Aligning stars might mean something like this -

Rasters terminology is available as a widget that edje can swallow.

An edje swallowed terminology can run a given command, then go away once
the command finishes.  Naturally that command could be "vi script.lsl",
"lua", or even "toybox sh".

Toybox and terminology works under cygwin and Mac OS X.

Rob pulls his finger out and starts putting my editing stuff in toybox
so I can progress with this.
