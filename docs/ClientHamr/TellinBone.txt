Wild idea while not getting to sleep -

Implement an Android "phone" in world.

If it's actually Android, then there's a big load of software available
for it already.  B-)

It can run Jabber/XMPP clients that connect to the worlds XMPP server. 
So most of the time it's just the chat/IM window.

It would usually be connected to the HUD, so private, but might be able
to pull it off the HUD and show it to others.  This part inspired by
Evas_3D claiming it can have Evas and Elm widgets as it's 3D textures.

The GPS system can track your avatars in world position.
