<p>Consider your inventory. A mess huh. Well, what is it really, especially in a world like <a href="NGIW.html">NGIW</a> / <a href="index.html">OMG</a> describes? It's just yet another hierarchy of folders and thingies. We are probably wasting our time writing any code for it. Why not leverage the users favourite hierarchy browser/editor. Maybe it's called FileDamager made by MicroCruft in Redstone Wishangton. Maybe it's called Netscape, or Nautilus. Many of the modern file browser tools will talk a protocol named WebDAV. If the asset server spoke WebDAV, then we could perhaps rip the inventory code clean out of the client.</p>
<p>This little fantasy points in a really blue sky direction. Use existing protocols and tools to remove stuff from the client. Make it easy for tools that already exist to interact with the 3d world.</p>
<p>That's the Client Hammer.</p>
<p>Note - The simian grid has a WebDav front end to inventory. <a href="http://code.google.com/p/openmetaverse/">http://code.google.com/p/openmetaverse/</a></p>
