/*  GuiLua - a GUI library that implements matrix-RAD style stuff.

Provides the skang and widget Lua packages.

This should be a library in the end, but for now it's just an
application that is a test bed for what goes into the library.  In the
initial intended use case, several applications will be using this all at
once, with one central app hosting all the GUIs.

Basically this should deal with "windows" and their contents.  A
"window" in this case is hosted in the central app as some sort of
internal window, but the user can "tear off" those windows, then they
get their own OS hosted window.  This could be done by the hosting app
sending the current window contents to the original app as a skang file.

Between the actual GUI and the app might be a socket, or a stdin/out
pipe.  Just like matrix-RAD, this should be transparent to the app. 
Also just like matrix-RAD, widgets can be connected to variable /
functions (C or Lua), and any twiddlings with those widgets runs the
function / changes the variable, again transparent to the app, except
for any registered get/set methods.

This interface between the GUI and the app is "skang" files, which are
basically Lua scripts.  The GUI and the app can send skang files back
and forth, usually the app sends actual GUI stuff, and usually the GUI
sends variable twiddles or action calls.  Usually.

To start with, this will be used to support multiple apps hosting their
windows in extantz, allowing the big viewer blob to be split up into
modules.  At some point converting LL XML based UI shit into skang could
be done.  Also, this should be an exntension to LuaSL, so in-world
scripts can have a poper GUI for a change.


NOTES and TODOs -

Making these packages all a sub package of skang seems like a great
idea.  On the other hand, looks like most things are just getting folded
into skang anyway.  See
http://www.inf.puc-rio.br/~roberto/pil2/chapter15.pdf part 15.5 for
package details.

See if I can use LuaJIT FFI here.  Since this will be a library, and
skang apps could be written in C or Lua, perhaps writing this library to
be FFI friendly instead of the usual Lua C binding might be the way to
go?

For the "GUI hosted in another app" case, we will need some sort of
internal window manager running in that other app.

This might end up running dozens of Lua scripts, and could use the LuaSL
Lua script running system.  Moving that into this library might be a
sane idea I think?  Or prehaps a separate library that both LuaSL and
GuiLua use?

Raster wants a method of sending Lua tables around as edje messages. 
Between C, Edje, Edje Lua, and Lua.  Sending between threads, and across
sockets.  Using a new edje message type, or eet for sockets, was
suggested, but perhaps Lua skang is a better choice?

Somehow access to the edje_lua2.c bindings should be provided.  And
bindings to the rest of EFL when they are done.  Assuming the other EFL
developers do proper introspection stuff, or let me do it.

The generic Lua binding helper functions I wrote for edje_lua2.c could
be used here as well, and expanded as discussed on the E devs mailing
list.  This would include the thread safe Lua function stuff copied
into the README.

There will eventually be a built in editor, like the zen editor from
matrix-RAD.  It might be a separate app.

NAWS should probably live in here to.  If I ever get around to writing
it.  lol

The pre tokenized widget structure thingy I had planned in the
matrix-RAD TODO just wont work, as it uses symbols.  On the other hand,
we will be using Lua tables anyway.  B-)

The last half of http://passingcuriosity.com/2009/extending-lua-in-c/
might be of use.

/* introspection

As detailed in README, EFL introspection doesn't seem to really be on
the radar, but I might get lucky, or I might have to write it myself. 
For quick and dirty early testing, I'll probably write a widget package
that has hard coded mappings between some basic "label", "button", etc.
and ordinary elementary widgets.  Proper introspection can come later.
