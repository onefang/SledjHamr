orig-5.1.3

This is a straightforward port of the Lua 5.1.3 front end (lexical
analyzer, parser, code generator, binary chunk dumper.)

The front end files are:

	lopcodes.lua	opcode definition
	lzio.lua	input streams
	llex.lua	lexical analyzer
	lparser.lua	parser
	lcode.lua	code generator
	ldump.lua	binary chunk dumper

Status: operational, passes all current tests (non-exhaustive)

Major test scripts are:

	test/test_llex.lua		exercises test cases
	test/test_lparser2.lua		exercises test cases

luac.lua is a clone of Lua 5.1.3's luac.lua, except that it generates a
binary chunk using Yueliang's front end implementation.

See the README file in orig-5.0.3 for a discussion.

The following is some performance data. Note that absolutely nothing has
been done to optimize the code; it is meant to mirror the original C as
an educational tool.

(1) Speed was benchmarked using a Sempron 3000+. Benchmark scripts are
in the test directories. Best of first three figures quoted. This is a
measurement of raw lexer speed, i.e. tokens are read but no processing
is done. All files are read in entirely before running the lexer.

For Lua 5.1.1, see Yueliang 0.2.1, which was the last release of Lua
5.1.1 material.

For Lua 5.1.2, see Yueliang 0.2.2, which was the last release of Lua
5.1.2 material.
