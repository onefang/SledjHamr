test_scripts-5.*.lua
----------------------

The scripts test_scripts*.lua are for exercising the frontends. Such
testing is non-exhaustive, but useful all the same.

The files in the 5.0 directory are the sample scripts from the Lua 5.0.x
test directory. Ditto for the 5.1 directory. See the COPYRIGHT_Lua5 for
the copyright notice.

For example, to run the 5.0.x script tester:

	>lua test_scripts-5.0.lua

Or, if you have both Lua 5.0.x and Lua 5.1.x, you can prepare two
binaries and run them like this:

	>lua5.0 test_scripts-5.0.lua
	>lua5.1 test_scripts-5.1.lua

If the compilation result is exact, "CORRECT" is printed, otherwise both
binary chunks are written to the current directory as bc1.out and
bc2.out. You can use a disassembly tool like ChunkSpy to generate
listings for both files, then they can be compared with a visual diff
tool. ChunkSpy 0.9.8 supports 5.0.x and 5.1.x.

For testing additional files, add the argument "ALL" like this:

	>lua test_scripts-5.0.lua ALL

This will pull in additional personal script files for testing. But in
order to do so, you'd have to adjust the files files-other-*.txt.

Current status:

Frontend version	File set			Result
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Yueliang 5.0.3		files-lua-5.0.txt		ALL CORRECT
			files-yueliang-5.0.txt		ALL CORRECT
Yueliang 5.1.2		files-lua-5.1.txt		ALL CORRECT
			files-yueliang-5.1.txt		ALL CORRECT
---------------------------------------------------------------------

test_parser-5.x.lua
-------------------

The script files test_parser-5.0.lua and test_parser-5.1.lua contains
many test cases for both parsers. There are a lot of failure cases as
well as pass cases in order to exercise the parsers well, though the
test list is not exhaustive.

	test_parser-5.0.lua	503 test cases
	test_parser-5.1.lua	524 test cases

For the actual test scripts, see test_lparser2.lua in the respective
test directories of each front end. The 5.0.x front end of Yueliang
passed all the tests in test_parser-5.0.lua without any failures, while
testing of the 5.1.x front end using test_parser-5.1.lua led to one
bug found and fixed.

For Lua 5.0.2, see Yueliang 0.1.3, which was the last release of Lua
5.0.2 material.

For Lua 5.1.1, see Yueliang 0.2.1, which was the last release of Lua
5.1.1 material.
