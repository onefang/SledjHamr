The original test scripts came via a circatious route to me.  So I have
no idea who wrote what.  Some of them are "created by Vektor Linden".  
Which would be a Linden Labs staff member, and not their real name.  
There does not seem to be any copyright notice.  They seem to be based
on a protocol that is detailed here -

http://wiki.secondlife.com/wiki/LSLTest

The scripts I have are not linked from that page anywhere I could find.

The actual protocol, server, client wrappers, etc is all way over
engineered, we are only interested in the actual tests.  So these get
morphed into much simpler, smaller, tests, little testicles.
