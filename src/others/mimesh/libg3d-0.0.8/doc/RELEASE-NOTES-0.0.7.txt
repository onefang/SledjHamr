libg3d 0.0.7 "now or never"
===========================

While there was a constant flow of changes and additions in the source code
repository it has been over a year since the last "official" release.

The 0.0.7 release introduces a lot of changes, most notably an abstraction
of the input stream, a lot of new and updated plugins, a handful of bug
fixes and some general improvements. Check the ChangeLog for some more
detailed information or just try it out.

The API should be fairly compatible and stable (and a little expanded),
the binary interface may have changed - I lost track - so please recompile
your applications.
If you are using G3DViewer it is highly recommended to update it as well.
