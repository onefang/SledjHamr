LIBG3D:

This library loads 3D models from various file formats. Its aim is to support
basic import functionality for as much formats as possible. More complete
support is better, of course, and the long time goal.

To help developing plugins and for general use, too, there are a lot of
basic 3d manipulation function, including vector and matrix math, common
file reading stuff, transformations and 3d primitive support.

other model plugins:
* heightfield: generates a landscape from an image
* test: some tests (primitives, transformation...)
* rbh: experimental, maybe Discworld Noir models (or no 3D at all ;))

IMAGE PLUGINS:

* bmp: Windows Bitmap, uncompressed, only 8-bit tested
* sgi: SGI RGB files, uncompressed & RLE, 8, 24, 32 bit
* GdkPixbuf: everything GdkPixbuf can load, GTK 2.x required
