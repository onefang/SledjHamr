Airfoils:
=========

* get airfoil data in .dat format, e.g. from:
  http://www.ae.uiuc.edu/m-selig/ads/archives/coord_seligFmt.tar.gz
  (search for "UIUC Airfoil Coordinates Database" if this link is broken).
  This data can be used according to the GNU General Public License.
* set the environment variable AIRFOIL_DIR to the path containing the
  dat files.
* without airfoil data .acf models are still loadable, but wings and stuff
  are missing.
* to minimize libg3d loading times (the airfoil data is loaded when this
  plugin is initialized, you don't have to try to load an .acf file) you
  could only install a selected subset of airfoil data files.
  Libg3d will complain about missing airfoil data files.
