There are some base libraries that should be used in common.  Notable
the Enlightenment Foundation Libraries (EFL), LuaJIT, luaproc, and
lemon.  Other external open source projects that we just use directly
should go here to.  Makes it easy to compile it all.

Note that in some cases, there might be changes.  Such changes should be
documented.

Irrlicht has been slightly modified to get it to use externally created
GL stuff.

luaproc has been hacked up a bit, and will continue to be hacked up. 
Merged it into LuaSL, so it's no longer here.

EFL has been released, so not including that anymore.  You can find it
in distro repos, PPA's, etc.  Or http://enlightenment.org/
