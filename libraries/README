There are some base libraries that should be used in common.  Notable
the Enlightenment Foundation Libraries (EFL), Irrlicht, lemon, LuaJIT,
and luaproc.  Other external open source projects that we just use
directly should go here to.  Makes it easy to compile it all.

Note that in some cases, there might be changes.  Such changes should be
documented, and marked with "// onefang changes".

EFL has been released, so not including that anymore.  You can find it
in distro repos, PPA's, etc.  Or http://enlightenment.org/

Irrlicht has been slightly modified to get it to use externally created
GL stuff, and not use their internal copies of bzip, jpeglib, libpng,
and zlib.

Lemon is from http://www.hwaci.com/sw/lemon/.

LuaJIT 2.0 has been released for Ubuntu 13.04 and later, try using
https://launchpad.net/~mwild1/+archive/ppa for 12.04.  Not including
that anymore.

luaproc has been hacked up a bit, and will continue to be hacked up. 
Merged it into LuaSL, so it's no longer here.
