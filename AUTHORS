David "onefang" Seikel wrote most of this, with the following exceptions

The avatar known as "Nathan Adored" wrote the first half of OMG-WTF-BBQ.

The avatar known as "Alice Crush" wrote the second half of OMG-WTF-BBQ
in conversation with onefang.  Alice also wrote BVJ, ClientHamr,
InworldAnimationEditor, NGIW, and NGIW.Commands.  Alice is likely
responsible for some little bits here and there.  Alice kinda wrote
BlackListAssetServersTracker, but that's currently the second half of
OMG-WTF-BBQ, and I need to move that.
