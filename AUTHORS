David "onefang" Seikel wrote most of this, with the following exceptions
in the docs directory -

The avatar known as "Nathan Adored" wrote the first part of OMG-WTF-BBQ,
with onefang supplying the COW stuff.

The avatar known as "Alice Crush" wrote BlackListAssetServersTracker in
conversation with onefang, with onefang untangling it at the end. 
Alice also wrote BVJ, the first half of ClientHamr,
InworldAnimationEditor, NGIW, and NGIW.Commands (onefang wrote the first
paragraph).  Alice is likely responsible for some little bits here and
there.
